        <p>As per the survey conducted by NewsWeek
          It all started with a vision.</p>
        <p>HM has been voted as the BEST PRIVATE HOSPITAL IN INDIA</p>
        <h6>HMâ€™s massive 2.1 million sq. ft. campus provides 1,600+ beds and houses facilities for over 22+ super-specialties, all under one roof. Each floor is dedicated to a specialisation to ensure that they function as independent hospitals within a hospital and yet have the comfort of collaborating on complex cases. Patients are provided with multiple options for treatment, the most suitable of which are arrived at through a cross-function, cross-specialisation committee such as Tumor board that decides the best course of action</h6>
